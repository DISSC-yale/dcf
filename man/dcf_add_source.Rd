\section{Project}{


Within a source project, there are two files to edits:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{\code{ingest.R}}: This is the primary script, which is automatically rerun.
    It should store raw data and resources in \code{raw/} where possible,
    then use what's in \code{raw/} to produce standard-format files in \code{standard/}.
    This file is sourced from its location during processing, so any system paths
    must be relative to itself.
  \item \strong{\code{measure_info.json}}: This is where you can record information
    about the variables included in the standardized data files.
    See \code{\link{dcf_measure_info}}.
}
}
